Alessandro Palumbo is an Associate Professor at [CentraleSupeléc](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) and an Associate Researcher at [IRISA Lab](https://www.irisa.fr/en), [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-rennes-university), [SUSHI Team](https://team.inria.fr/sushi/).

His research focus is Hardware Security. In particular, his interests include hardware acceleration of networking functions and CPU microarchitectures, with particular emphasis on Machine Learning techniques and Probabilistic Data Structures to guarantee security and reliability in microprocessor-based systems in both FPGA and In-Memory Computing scenarios.

For a couple of years, he has also been investigating Natural Language Processing and Large Language Model techniques, aiming to carry out further digital decision-making processes.

He worked in SHANNON, SESAMO, 5G-PICTURE, POR FESR 2014/2020 EU projects.

From April 2024 to July 2024, he was a Visiting Researcher at the [International Computer Science Institute (ICSI)](https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/), [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) (research work funded by [NGI Enrichers](https://enrichers.ngi.eu/), more information [here](https://enrichers.ngi.eu/fellow/alessandro-palumbo/)).

In 2022/2023 A.Y., he was an Assistant Researcher and a Contract Professor at the [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en). There, his research activity was titled “Design of Integrated Circuits for High-Security Primitive of In-Memory Computing.”

In 2021/2022 A.Y., he was a Contract Professor at the [University of Milan "Bicocca"](https://en.unimib.it/).

In 2021/2022 and 2020/2021 A.Y., he was a Teaching Assistant at the [University of Rome "Tor Vergata"](https://web.uniroma2.it/en).
There, he received a Ph.D. in Electronics Engineering in 2022 for his research work titled [“Features Analysis of Microarchitectural Attacks and Hardware Trojans in Microprocessors: Detection & Mitigation Techniques”](https://centralesupelec-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/alessandro_palumbo_centralesupelec_fr/EUBJZAidHXZFuDHxFtq1yngBKyGQWPrEjapn2FLPVRbJxQ?e=9LeEQm).

In 2019, he took a master’s degree in Electronics Engineering for Telecommunications and Multimedia at the same university, where he also received his bachelor’s degree in Electronics Engineering in 2016.

From April 2018 to October 2019, he was a Researcher at [CNIT](https://www.cnit.it/en/).
